# Fashion Recommender System

This project implements a fashion recommender system that takes an image as input and provides related fashion images as output. The system uses ResNet50 for image classification and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for finding the nearest images based on the desired fashion.

## Overview

The recommender system processes input images of fashion items, classifies them using a ResNet50 model, and then finds similar fashion items from a dataset using KNN. This approach helps users discover related fashion items based on the visual characteristics of the input image.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** Uses ResNet50 to classify input images into predefined fashion categories.
- **Similarity Search:** Employs KNN to find and recommend similar fashion images based on the classified category.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive way to explore fashion items by uploading an image and receiving related recommendations.
